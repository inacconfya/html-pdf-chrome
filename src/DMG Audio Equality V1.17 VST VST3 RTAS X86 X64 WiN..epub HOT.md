# DMG Audio Equality V1.17: The Universal EQ for Windows
 
DMG Audio Equality V1.17 is a powerful and versatile equalizer plugin that can handle any mixing or mastering task. Whether you need a transparent linear-phase EQ, a smooth analog-style EQ, or a creative minimum-phase EQ, Equality V1.17 has you covered. You can choose from six bands of parametric EQ, two shelf/bell filters, and two high-pass and low-pass filters, with up to 48 dB/octave slopes. You can also adjust the gain-Q interaction, the frequency shift, and the range of the EQ curve to suit your preferences.
 
Equality V1.17 supports VST, VST3, RTAS, and AAX formats for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows systems. It also features a high-resolution spectrum analyzer, a configurable VU meter, M/S processing modes, and A/B comparison. You can save and recall presets, undo and redo changes, and use the autolisten mode to quickly find and tweak problem frequencies. Equality V1.17 is designed to be the perfect EQ to let your mixdowns shine, with high-quality sound and low CPU usage.

One of the main features of Equality V1.17 is the ability to switch between different modes of EQ operation. You can choose from linear-phase, analog, and minimum-phase modes, depending on your needs and preferences. Linear-phase mode preserves the phase relationships of the input signal, ensuring no phase distortion or pre-ringing artifacts. Analog mode emulates the smooth and musical response of analog hardware EQs, with variable phase shift and harmonic distortion. Minimum-phase mode offers a more creative and flexible option, with sharper filters and faster response times.
 
Another feature of Equality V1.17 is the high-resolution spectrum analyzer, which shows you the frequency spectrum of the input and output signals, as well as the EQ curve. You can adjust the resolution, speed, and range of the analyzer, as well as the color scheme and the display mode. You can also use the analyzer to perform spectral matching, by importing a reference track and applying its frequency balance to your own track. This can help you achieve a more consistent and professional sound across different tracks or genres.
 
Equality V1.17 also offers a variety of options for fine-tuning your EQ settings. You can link the controls of different bands or filters, to make simultaneous adjustments with ease. You can also use the range knob to scale the gain of all bands at once, allowing you to make subtle or drastic changes without affecting the shape of the curve. You can also use the frequency shift knob to shift the entire EQ curve left or right, which can be useful for tuning instruments or vocals. Finally, you can use the autolisten mode to solo each band or filter, and hear how it affects your signal.
