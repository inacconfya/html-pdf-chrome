The Streetsweeper Vol. 1 was released in 2003 by Columbia Records as DJ Kayslay's major-label debut. It was intended to replicate one of his underground mixes, but with properly licensed performers and beats. The result was a critically acclaimed album that showcased DJ Kayslay's skills as a curator and a host of some of the hottest tracks and freestyles of the time.
  
However, if you want to listen to The Streetsweeper Vol. 1 today, you might have a hard time finding it on streaming platforms or online stores.
