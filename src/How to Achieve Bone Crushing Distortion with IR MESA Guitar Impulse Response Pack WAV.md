How to Use IRs in Your DAW
 
If you want to use IRs in your digital audio workstation (DAW), you will need a plugin that can load and process them. There are many plugins available for this purpose, such as:

- Two Notes Wall of Sound
- Neural DSP plugins
- Line 6 Helix Native
- Positive Grid BIAS FX 2
- Ignite Amps NadIR

These plugins allow you to load IRs from your computer and apply them to your guitar signal. You can also adjust parameters such as volume, pan, phase, EQ and more. Some plugins also let you blend multiple IRs together for a more complex tone.
 
To use IRs in your DAW, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Record your guitar signal using a direct input (DI) or an amp simulator without a cabinet simulation.
2. Insert an IR loader plugin on the same track or on a separate track with a send/return configuration.
3. Browse and load the IRs you want to use from your computer. You can use the presets or the user folder to access your IRs.
4. Tweak the settings of the plugin and the IRs until you are happy with the tone.
5. Render or export your track with the IRs applied.

Here is an example of how to use IRs with Neural DSP plugins[^1^]:
  ```markdown 1. Choose your IRs: There are a ton of free and paid IRs available on the internet, including the "Declassified: Impulse Responses for Rock and Metal" pack from Modern Metal Songwriter. Choose the IRs that best suit your desired tone. 2. Open your Neural DSP plugin: Open your preferred Neural DSP plugin in your DAW. 3. Load your IRs: Click on the "CAB" section of the plugin and then click on the "IR" button. A window will pop up where you can load up to four IRs at a time. You can drag and drop IRs from your computer or use the browser to navigate through your folders. 4. Adjust your IRs: You can adjust the volume, pan, phase and delay of each IR using the knobs below each slot. You can also solo or mute each IR using the buttons above each slot. You can also use the EQ section to shape your tone further. 5. Save your preset: Once you are happy with your tone, you can save your preset by clicking on the "SAVE" button in the upper-right corner of the plugin window. You can name your preset and assign it to a category for easy access later. ``` 8cf37b1e13
